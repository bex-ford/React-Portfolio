          Hey! My name is Bex and i'm currently learning front end web
          development. I started the skills bootcamp course november 2022 and i
          will be complete in march 2023. I am wanting to change my career from
          dentistry to a full time front end developer. That is my goal for
          2023. I have a long way to go to be confident in coding however i am
          determined to make a success of this bootcamp course.
        </p>
